        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Over a focused 3-month experiment, I launched a complete Amazon FBA used-books
            operation. I wanted to learn the economics, constraints, and operational realities of selling through Amazon’s
            fulfillment network. I documented everything from sourcing to shipping, performed
            full analytics on revenue and cost, and scaled the operation to four inbound FBA
            shipments and ~500 evaluated books.
        </p>

        <!-- What I Built -->
        <h2>What I Built</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Set up an Amazon Professional Seller account and learned the ungating process,
                category restrictions, and fulfillment rules.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sourced ~500 used books through bulk pickups, thrift stores, and pre-filtered collections.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used tools such as ScoutIQ and Amazon Seller App to analyze
                product rank, eScore, competition, and projected profitability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Managed initail logistics: scanning inventory, prepping, labeling, packaging,
                and submitting four FBA shipments totaling 55+ sellable units.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducted repricing analytics—monitoring page views, adjusting price floors/ceilings,
                and evaluating stale inventory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tracked work hours, expenses, fees, and revenue to determine true hourly ROI.
            </li>
        </ul>
