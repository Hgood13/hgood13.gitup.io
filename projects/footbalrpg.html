    <h1>Defense & Dragroutes — AI Football RPG</h1>
</header>

<section class="section">

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Defense & Dragroutes is a two-player American-football RPG powered by 1d20 mechanics and
        real-time AI narration. Offense and defense players secretly select plays, the engine resolves
        outcomes based on system tables, and the game narrates results using dynamic prompts to the ChatGPT API.
        I built the web UI, game logic, and the narration framework.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Built</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed the 1d20 outcome system, play tables, coverage shells, and state machine.</li>
        <li>Built the full HTML/CSS/JS front-end with a 4-panel grid interface.</li>
        <li>Implemented API calls for live AI narration based on play selections.</li>
        <li>Created hidden play-call mechanics so opponents cannot see choices.</li>
        <li>Developed formation previews, defensive disguises, and buffered outcomes.</li>
        <li>Prototyped gameplay loops and session logic for repeated drives and quarters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a unique hybrid between tabletop RPG logic and football strategy.</li>
        <li>Developed reusable game-state structures for future game expansions.</li>
        <li>Delivered a functional local multiplayer experience over a simple web UI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (game logic)</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS (grid layout)</li>
        <li>ChatGPT API</li>
        <li>Dice-based probability modeling</li>
    </ul>
