    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a React-based logic game inspired by Wordle and Connections. Players guess an object
        using progressively clearer clues. The game includes dynamic state management, clue iteration, scoring,
        animations, and a mobile-responsive UI with a Wordle-inspired aesthetic.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Built</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed the entire React front-end using functional components and Hooks.</li>
        <li>Built the progressive clue engine with adjustable difficulty.</li>
        <li>Implemented guess validation, history tracking, and per-round scoring.</li>
        <li>Designed a sleek UI with emoji feedback, animations, and dark-theme elements.</li>
        <li>Created responsive layouts for mobile and desktop play.</li>
        <li>Iteratively tested difficulty balance and user experience flows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Built a complete mini-game with replayability and difficulty tuning.</li>
        <li>Learned deeper React patterns and state synchronization concepts.</li>
        <li>Created a foundation for a larger, multi-round puzzle experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>React (Hooks, state, effects)</li>
